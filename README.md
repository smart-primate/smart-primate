ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Siddhant.
A Geophysicist by profession, Iâ€™m currently developing my skills in Machine Learning, especially Deep Learning. I am fascinated by the potential to marry my existing knowledge of seismic data analysis and my newly acquired skills in deep learning. Hence, I am looking to collaborate on projects where I can contribute with my experience working with seismic data and my relatively new skills with Deep Learning.

Please feel free to reach out to me via email: smart.primate13@gmail.com or siddhant.pattanaik@gmail.com.
